# The Structure of Good Policy Arguments

Social scientists often claim their relevance through policy recommendations, but it's often unclear how these should be interpreted by actual policymakers and other stakeholders. _How do we get a higher growth rate?_, _How do we improve school wellbeing?_ are questions social science experts should be able to help policymakers answer. However, it's often not stated clearly under which circumstances these recommendations yield the expected results. Are they (more or less) normative statements about policies in that area, or predictive statements—i.e., claims that the policy, if implemented, would yield the desired results? The right standard for expert statements in public debates is whether the implied counterfactual is realistic. A policy recommendation can be true conditional on a model of the world: if the policy is politically feasible, palatable, and the right resources are thrown at it, it might be the best course of action. But is this really a good characterization of the real world? In other words, policy recommendations should be valued for their predictive quality about a counterfactual world where the policy was implemented. Throughout this blog, I cover two examples: (1) a CO2 tax and (2) rent control in Copenhagen. We begin with the first and end with the second.

## What is a policy argument

So what is a policy argument? I would suggest they can broadly be categorized into two groups:

1) Statements about the properties of the policy.
2) Statements about the real world under a given policy.

The first are statements about desirable (or undesirable) attributes of the policy, e.g. in the case of a carbon tax, allocating the right to pollute to those most willing to pay. Often these arguments are good, not necessarily because they are implementable, but because they highlight a desirable way to think about policies in a given area. The second, at its core, is a claim about a counterfactual: what would happen to some outcome if we did policy A rather than policy B (or the status quo). The point here is not to say what should be valued, but to say what would happen, given the world we live in. A good policy argument, in the second category, therefore succeeds to the extent that its implied counterfactual is realistic.

However, there is a common ambiguity in policy recommendations: which counterfactual world are we talking about? Is it the real world, with messy politics, limited state capacity, and voters who might punish you for higher gas prices? Or is it a hypothetical world where the policy is implemented cleanly, enforced perfectly, and kept in place for decades? In practice, economists (and other social scientists) often slide between these worlds without saying so, i.e. without stating whether it is the first category or the second. In this blog, I emphasize policy arguments about the real world.

Concretely, a policy argument always rests on a model. Here I use “model” in the broad sense: a set of assumptions about behavior, institutions, enforcement, and time horizons that lets you translate “implement policy A” into “here is what happens next.” The model can be implicit or explicit, but it is always there. And because it is there, any policy conclusion is conditional on it.

This brings us to the key complication: model uncertainty. There are usually multiple plausible models of how the world will respond. A responsible policy argument should therefore ask: under each plausible model, what would happen under policy A and under policy B? And then, instead of pretending one model is “the truth,” we should weight the models by how plausible we think they are and average the outcomes. Put differently, the argument is not “A is best under my favorite model,” but “A is best after accounting for the fact that the world might work differently.”

One important observation follows immediately: model uncertainty only matters when different plausible models rank the policies differently. If every reasonable model points to the same policy, then it's easy to choose between policies; however, that's rarely the case. The optimal policy is not always the same across models; the “missing assumptions” become the whole argument.

# Demand and Supply and the Welfare Theorems Dominate (as they should)

Often what happens in practice, especially when economists make recommendations, is that they focus on a demand and supply model and the first and second welfare theorems. Not to go into too much detail, they assume individuals generally are well informed and are able to make somewhat _utility-maximizing_ decisions, i.e. people allocate their money towards the consumption and investments they prefer. Additionally, they assume that markets are able to _clear_, that is, the price system will allow for getting the economy into an equilibrium, i.e. individuals would not prefer to alter their _consumption basket_ at given prices. Additionally, economists usually invoke the second welfare theorem, which states that we can redistribute resources (concretely, tax the rich and give to the poor). After this transfer, prices will readjust the economy into a new equilibrium.

This is a very effective framework for thinking about policies and should also be the first tool an expert reaches for, in my opinion, when giving recommendations. In the case of climate change, the idea is that there is an externality (carbon emissions) that is not properly captured by the price system. Both cap-and-trade and carbon taxes try to internalize these externalities and express policy in a standard supply-and-demand framework, so people will reevaluate their consumption patterns given they now have to pay for their emissions.

The insight here is that recommending a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system is a really good idea if it is politically feasible and palatable, which is probably not the case in the real world; the policy recommendation suddenly becomes a statement about something completely different than how to effectively reduce emissions. It's a statement about efficiency and how to internalize externalities. It's a bait-and-switch, exchanging one question for another.

# Elaborating on the Carbon Tax Example

Let's now consider the idea of reducing emissions in more detail. Imagine a center-left government asking for advice on reducing carbon emissions. We consider a policymaker choosing between two policies.

- A carbon tax (A)
- An investment fund in green infrastructure (B)

For simplicity and clarity, we restrict ourselves to two models with starkly different policy recommendations. In one model, any policy implemented will have an infinite lifetime, i.e., a carbon tax (or investment fund) will sustain itself until its planned termination (say 10 years in the future). Conversely, we also consider a model where the opposition party, if winning, will reverse a carbon tax but not be able to shut down the climate fund. We can draw CO2 emissions (y-axis) as a function of time (x-axis), and we can draw the outcome under the different models in different colors (red and green). Finally, we can summarize aggregate carbon emissions in one number under each model. In other words, we are considering two policies under two models: a pure _optimal efficiency_ model and a game-theoretic election model.

*Inserting figure carbon_emissions_by_model*

Next, we can think about the probabilities of each model being true. Finally, we can plot the expected carbon emissions of each policy (y-axis) under varying probabilities of which model is true (x-axis). Where the policies' expectations intersect is where one should switch between preferring an investment fund or a carbon tax.

*Inserting figure carbon_cumulative_vs_probability*

As seen from the plot, it's not exactly obvious what the best policy recommendation is; it's strictly a function of what we believe about how real-world politics actually work.

# Just use prediction markets

One somewhat obvious way is to make markets for policy recommendations. If experts really believe that a carbon tax will reduce a country's emissions by a certain amount at a given time horizon, then they should put their money where their mouths are. This is, of course, not the case for category 1 policy recommendations. It's perfectly reasonable to highlight the strengths of a carbon tax without claiming it's the most effective way to reduce emissions, but making policy recommendations more incentive-driven would probably be a healthy exercise and inject a healthy dose of epistemic discipline into expert advice.

This would, additionally, be a very inexpensive way to survey a discipline about the effects of a policy and a way to make academics and think tanks work for their money. Concretely, publicly awarded grants could have 20 percent of the funds allocated into _expertise markets_, where an appropriate incentive structure was implemented for providing advice. In the long run, it would give academics and other experts healthier feedback on whether their beliefs are accurate (considering the work of Philip Tetlock, we should probably be skeptical about that), and it would be a way to discipline policymakers. Most policies are expensive, and if policymakers bet against experts or make choices that are at odds with what is suggested, it would be an effective way to communicate this publicly while still avoiding an overly political angle, which sometimes can be seen in certain academic fields without being supported by anything other than political convictions.

# Rent Control in Copenhagen

Let's return to a topic of a previous article, [the housing market](https://open.substack.com/pub/unreasonabledoubt/p/why-new-housing-lowers-or-raises?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web), concretely, rent control. In the public debate, rent control has been suggested primarily by left-wing politicians as a way to combat rising housing costs in Copenhagen. Going back to the model presented earlier, this could be considered a bad idea. Why? Because in the long run, we would suspect that supply would shrink, or at least not expand adequately. The price cap would artificially lower the aggregate supply of housing in the city, effectively removing the possibility for many to move to the city. Again, I believe the (expanded) 101 reading of the economic problem is correct. Price controls have some pretty bad consequences for supply. That said, in the case of Copenhagen, do I really believe that removing rent control would have any substantial effect on supply? Honestly, no, at least not through the channel of more new housing. I would not put my money on it, and I do not think many of the proponents of removing rent controls would either. The limited new housing in Copenhagen is not due to price controls, but the lack of political will (especially by the left-wing) to build more. Poorly thought out environmental protection (link) and climate considerations (link) are more likely the real reasons why Copenhagen is behind on building more housing. Looking at the actual data, we can see that the left-wing parties in Copenhagen, even though they keep talking about more and affordable housing, are actually voting against it (link). If rent control is what makes building more feasible, i.e. it makes it politically more expensive for the left-wing parties to not build more, then rent control becomes the YIMBY policy position.

# Conclusion

So how should we think about policy recommendations? The first step is to separate claims about a policy's properties from claims about real-world outcomes, and to state the model that connects the policy to the outcome. The second step is to confront model uncertainty: if plausible models rank policies differently, the recommendation should be a weighted judgment about which model is more likely, not a claim of certainty. That discipline makes policy advice more honest about the counterfactual world it is actually describing.
