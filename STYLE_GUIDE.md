# Unreasonable Doubt — Voice & Style Guide

This guide distills the tone and structure seen in the prior posts in `old_blogs_style/`.

## Voice
- **Analytical but accessible:** Explain ideas as if to a smart general audience.
- **Model-first reasoning:** Start from assumptions, build a mechanism, then derive implications.
- **Confident and precise:** State claims clearly, qualify when needed.
- **Conversational clarity:** Use short transitions and signposts to keep readers oriented.

## Typical structure
1. **Hook + motivation**: Why the question matters now.
2. **Problem setup**: Define the debate or puzzle.
3. **Model**: Lay out assumptions and the simple framework.
4. **Mechanism**: Walk through how the model behaves.
5. **Implications**: What the model clarifies; who wins/loses.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarize the main takeaway.
7. **Footnotes / references**: Brief citations or clarifications.

## Language patterns to reuse
- “Concretely, ...”
- “Intuitively, ...”
- “Put differently, ...”
- “Summarizing, ...”
- “This is not a prediction; it’s a disciplined way to reason about ...”

## Formatting
- Use short sections with informative headings.
- Include bullet lists for steps, assumptions, or key takeaways.
- When using equations, keep them simple and explain each parameter in plain language.
- If figures are referenced, describe what the axes represent and the causal chain.

## Do / Don’t
- **Do** define terms early and reuse them consistently.
- **Do** walk through at least one worked example.
- **Do** distinguish between competing intuitions before resolving them.
- **Don’t** assume technical background without quick definitions.
- **Don’t** over-hedge; be clear about what the model does and does not show.

## Evidence and sourcing
- Cite empirical facts or outside claims succinctly.
- Prefer authoritative sources; link only when necessary.
