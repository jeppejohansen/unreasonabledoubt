Why Tinder Benefits the BeautifulSearch frictions and match fractions, and who is better off in a world of online dating.UNREASONABLE DOUBTNOV 12, 2024ShareBy Jeppe JohansenOnline dating is still becoming a more and more popular tool for 4nding a partner —just look at the graph below1. Intuitively, this makes sense. It’s hard to see who issingle and open for a relationship when roaming the real world. However, onlinedating allows for easy identi4cation of other people looking for a relationship.Especially with the advent of Tinder, it is not uncommon for people to have hundredsif not thousands of matches. That is, singles have hundreds of potential relationships,in the sense that both parties have, at least on a very super4cial level, sent a signal ofromantic interest. However, many of these people do not end up in relationships. IfTinder really worked, should we not expect a wave of relationships to be formed and atotal extinction of singledom? Yet, this is not what statistics tells us. As the 4gurebelow shows, though people meet online they are still more single than ever — thisblog post explores why. Speci4cally, this post distills why it is important to distinguishbetween search friction and match friction. Finally, it also investigates who are thewinners and losers of Tinder (and more generally online dating) and why immensereductions in search frictions for partners do not necessarily bene4t everyone.

Let’s start by setting the stage. To explore the questions above we start by setting up amodel. The model used in this post considers a world where men sequentially proposeto women who tentatively accept the relationship until a better man swings by. Whenthe men in the model have hit up all the women they were interested in the datinggame ends.Concretely, consider a single-period game, where all men in the “economy” areendowed with k possible women to ask out for a date (we only assume heterosexualrelations). Concretely, we could imagine that all men have exactly 5 potentialrelationship candidates. This is of course a simpli4cation as men know a varyingnumber of single women in real life, however, this simpli4cation does not change theresults of the model. These potential partners do not necessarily need to be attractive

enough for the men to want to enter relationships with them (or vice versa), rather theyconsist of the pool of potential partners, i.e. singles.Now, there is a speci4c cost to invest in getting a date. First, you use time and eUort toget in contact, and secondly, humans allocate emotional real estate in getting a date. Inthis very simple world, only men ask women out. Again, a simplifying assumption forgetting anywhere with the model.Finally, we also assume that all men and women have a certain level of attractiveness.The attractiveness is de4ned below, where the attractiveness level is between 0 and 10.The attractiveness level is composed of two subcomponents:1. A general attractiveness level (v)2. A personal (unique/idiosyncratic) attractiveness level (v_i):So intuitively the attractiveness of a person can be considered a weighted averagebetween an attractiveness level shared by everyone, called v, and a unique(idiosyncratic) to the individual level denoted v with subscript i. So intuitively allwomen will rate the men on a scale from 1 to 10. If alpha (the funny looking a in theequation) is 1, all the women will rate the same man equally. Put diUerently under aregime of alpha=1 a man rated by one woman as 7.2 will also be rated exactly as 7.2 byanother woman. However, if alpha=0 then there will be no correlation between ratingsof the same man for diUerent women, i.e. one woman will give a man 3.4, and otherwomen will come to an entirely diUerent level of attractiveness. Finally, men value theattractiveness of women by the same model as women do of men.Now we also need to model how men decide who they will try to get on a date. Asdescribed in the beginning they have k potential women they can try to get on a date,

but it’s costly to try to get a woman on a date. We model this the following way: Themen rank all the women by attractiveness and then have a decision rule whether or notthey want to date them. The rule is given as attractiveness minus the cost needs to beabove some threshold:Here i denotes the man and j denotes the index of the woman. Again consider the kwomen sorted by attractiveness, then the third most attractive woman will be indexedwith j=3. So the formula applied a - j*c is attractiveness minus the index j times thecost.The parameter t represents the threshold, that attractiveness - cost must be abovefor the man to try to get a date. Below is a simple example:Mike has 5 single women in his life he potentially could get in a relationship with,ordered by his preferences, they are Anna, Beatrice, Caroline, Denice, and Ellen. On a10-point scale a rank them 7,5,4,2,1, respectively (again, I hope this reader knows thisdoes not reaect my actual view of how this goes, on but helps as a simplifying view).We can now calculate the values. For simplicity assume the cost parameter c is 1, andhis threshold is 0:• Anna: 7 - 1*1 = 6 > 0 (Mike invites Anna on a date)• Beatrice: 5 - 2*1= 3 > 0 (Mike invites Beatrice on a date)• Caroline: 4 - 3*1 = 1 > 0 (Mike invites Caroline on a date)• Denice: 2 - 4*1 = -2 < 0 (Mike does not invite Denice on a date)• Ellen: 1 - 5*1 = -4 < 0 (Mike does not invite Denice on a date)We see that given his options, Mike will choose to get into a relationship with Anna,Beatrice, and Caroline (in that order), but he will pass on Denice and Ellen. However,dating markets have the important property, that you are only committed to onerelationship at a time. I.e. if Mike asks Anna out and they get into a relationship thenTrytogetdateij={Yes,if αi,j−j×c≥tNoelse

Beatrice and Caroline will never get the chance, even if they would have liked to.Concretely, in this model, men interact with all the women that they 4nd attractiveenough, i.e. even though Mike can only get into a relationship with one, he contacts allthree candidates. This is explored in more depth in the next section. Finally, also notethat had Mike only been presented to Denice (and not Anna, Beatrice, Caroline, andEllen) he would have tried to go on a date with her, since she would be indexed withj=1, such that:• Denice: 2 - 1*1 = 1 > 0 (Mike invites Denice on a date)Again this is only the case because in this example, Mike has not been presented withother women than Denice, so he has not invested energy in trying to get on dates withother women. In other words, the women Mike decides to try to get into a relationshipwith is contingent on the total pool of potential partners he is presented with.After all the men have “suited” the women they deemed attractive enough, the womenalso sort the “suiters” by attractiveness. Following this the market is “cleared” that isthe matching process is performed by the Gale-Shapley/Deferred acceptancealgorithm. The process can heuristically be understood like this:1. Initialization:◦ Every man and woman is initially single.◦ Each man has a list of women in order of his preference.◦ Each woman has a list of men in order of her preference.2. Proposal:◦ Each day, every single man proposes to the top woman on his list (the womanhe most prefers and hasn’t proposed to yet).Clearing The (Dating) Market

◦ After the proposals, the women look at all their suitors of the day and ifthey're single, they'll "tentatively" accept the proposal from the man they likemost. If they already have a tentative partner but prefer the new suitor more,they will "break up" with the current suitor and tentatively accept the newsuitor's proposal. The rejected man will move on to the next woman on his listthe following day.3. Rejection and Further Proposals:◦ The rejected men from the previous day will propose to the next woman ontheir list.◦ Again, each woman will pick her most preferred suitor from her currenttentative partner and the new suitors of the day.4. Termination:◦ This process continues with men proposing to the next woman on their listafter facing rejections until every man and every woman is paired up. Oralternatively, the men’s lists are exhausted.The Gale-Shapley algorithm has multiple nice properties, but for this application,those are not necessary to hash out. More importantly is it, to a 4rst-orderapproximation, a good description of the dating market.Before moving to the next section, which more closely compares how Tinder impactsdating markets, let’s 4rst consider the diUerence between search friction and matchfriction. Search friction is commonly used to describe inekciencies that arise whenindividuals attempt to 4nd mutually bene4cial transactions, however, in this model,it’s more narrowly de4ned as the number of potential partners the individuals couldtry to get on a date k. Match friction in this model refers to how the aggregate marketis characterized with regard to the number of relationships..In this model searchSearch Friction and Match Friction

friction simply conveys how big the potential pool of relationship partners is,concretely k. So reducing search friction would correspond to increasing k in thismodel. Again we see this is an important parameter in dating markets. It has also beenrecognized earlier as a reason why sexual minorities move to big cities since if the poolof potential partners is very small, it is natural to think it is very hard to 4nd a partner.In this model match friction is not captured by a parameter but corresponds to theaggregate number of matches in the dating market. A dating market with a lot of matchfriction will be characterized by a large number of singles, relative to the number ofpeople in relationships. It is important to distinguish between these two types offrictions, since, one can easily see how one can make a mental leap from reducingsearch friction to implying a reduction in match friction. However, as the paragraphbelow investigates, this is not necessarily the case: When preferences are correlated,i.e. people generally consider the same people attractive, reducing search cost mightnot lead to less match friction.Let us 4nally consider the advent of Tinder. Tinder can be considered as a way toreduce search friction, or put diUerently, increase the number of women men canpotentially try to get on a date, k. So, the question we can ask with this model iswhether a world with reduced search frictions will be characterized by more matches/relationship, i.e. also reduce match friction. We use our model to simulate the diUerentscenarios. We simulate 2500 men and 2500 women. We consider diUerent scenariosalong two dimensions:1. The extent to which people share preferences.2. The degree of search friction.We consider a range of values of alpha i.e. the extent to which people shareattractiveness valuations, andthe number of potential suiters for women. First, weSimulating Tinder vs The Good Old Days

assume a range of values on the interval between 0 and 1 of alpha. Secondly thenumber of potential suiters k go from 3 to 60. We evaluate the output of the model onthe following two metrics: 1) Total number of relationships (denoted matches in theplots) in the economy, and 2) The average attractiveness of men and women in arelationship. These metrics allow us to roughly reason about who is better oU andworse oU in a world with Tinder. Concretely, will a tool like Tinder create more orfewer relationships, and will the people in relationships appear more or lessattractive2.To summarize, when search friction is reduced, does the match friction then go up ordown? Does it actually become easier to get in a relationship, in a world where Tinderexists?The 4gures below show the results. The three plots show the number of potentialpartners on the x-axis (what is called k in the model). Again, consider a low number ofpotential partners as the pre-Tinder era, and conversely a high number of potentialpartners as the post-Tinder era. The colours of the lines denote the extent of howpreferences correlate, going from blue to red, where blue captures where preferencesare perfectly uncorrelated (alpha=0), and red captures when they are perfectlycorrelated (alpha=1). Note, that empirical preferences have been shown to display ahigh degree of correlation, i.e. the real world seems closer to the red than the blueline.3Simulation Results

The leftmost plot shows how the aggregate total number of relationships evolvesunder the diUerent scenarios. This is captured by the y-axis that denotes the totalnumber of relationships, which is denoted number of matches on the y-axis label. Asthe plot shows, the degree to which reducing search friction increases the number ofrelationships is very contingent on how correlated preferences are. Put diUerently,Tinder only increases the total number of relationships, if individuals’ preferencesdiUer. If everyone thinks the same people are attractive, Tinder actually reduces thetotal number of relationships.Next, even though attractiveness is hard to reason about when it includes anidiosyncratic component, one 4nds a very consistent pattern, namely, that reducingsearch friction increases the (perceived) attractiveness of people in relationships, atleast as experienced by their partner, because a larger dating pool allows people tomatch with more attractive partners. This can be seen from the middle and rightmostplot. The y-axis captures the average attractiveness of women and men in arelationship, respectively, which is seen increasing as k increases. Interestingly, thepicture is more murky with respect alpha, where the alpha of approximately 0.5 (anintermediate value between the two extremes), is associated with the lowest perceivedattractiveness. Intuitively this happens because now preferences are correlated, socongestion becomes a more prominent feature of the market, however, people are stillto a high degree ending up in relationships, i.e. as alpha increases, still fewer will endup in relationships.

Combining these two insights yields an important lesson. In a world with a highdegree of shared preferences for partners, reducing search friction makes the worldmore of a winner-take-all market. Intuitively, this can be understood as when thedating pool expands, more people can approach the most attractive candidates,allowing for “mating congestion” where everyone aocks around the same fewattractive candidates. Due to the cost component in the model, which we intuitivelycan think of as time or energy, women who would be deemed attractive to the males ina model with fewer partners become unattractive as the pool increases.Why has Tinder not caused a wave of new relationships, and reduced the number ofsingles in the modern dating environment? As outlined, Tinder reduces only one kindof friction, namely search friction and this is not the only important variable in a datingmarket. Concretely, as the simulations show, when people share preferences forpartners, reducing the search friction by increasing the pool of partners can actuallyhave the complete opposite eUect of what is intended, namely more unwilling singles.Additionally, the simulations show that the gains of the larger pool of potentialromantic partners accrue to the people who in general are deemed attractive.Concretely, having access to a larger pool of potential partners does not help everyone,only the select few, everyone wants to end up with.Jeppe Johansen is a regular writer at Unreasonable Doubt, where he writes about aliens,economics, the integrity of institutions, and everything in between – if anything really.
