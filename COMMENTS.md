# Comments and Tightening Notes

## policy_arguments_framework

### policy_blog.md
- Intro is clearer but still long; consider collapsing to a 2-3 sentence thesis plus a one-sentence roadmap.
- Reduce remaining rhetorical questions in the intro by converting them to declarative claims.
- Consider shortening the welfare-theorem section heading or splitting the paragraph for readability.
- The prediction markets section still reads long; consider tightening to one paragraph plus a concrete proposal sentence.
- In the rent control section, explicitly state the counterfactual being evaluated (e.g., "removing rent control without changing permitting constraints").

Links and placeholders to fill:
- Replace `(link)` placeholders with sources for environmental protection, climate considerations, and voting data.
- Keep external links in standard Markdown format.

- Reference only. Use these posts to check tone and paragraph length, but avoid copying phrasing.
